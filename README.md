<h1>Bookshell</h1>

Bookshell is a tool to create online mobile versions of traditional paper handouts at events. Bookshell can be used for art exhibitions, theatre programmes, sports! and much more. 

This project aims to address unecessary paper waste along with reducing printing costs. 

Bookshell aims to be an accessible app. Please get in touch if you would like to suggest any improvements.
